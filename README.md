# Identifying-Shopping-Trends-using-Data-Analysis-P3
**AICTE** - Internship on AI: Transformative Learning with TechSaksham – A joint CSR initiative of Microsoft & SAP, focusing on AI Technologies.  Selected project :- Identifying Shopping Trends using Data Analysis (P3)
Problem statement : Retail businesses accumulate vast amounts of shopping data from multiple channels (in-store, online, etc.), but struggle to effectively analyze this data to identify emerging trends, customer preferences, and seasonal buying patterns. To address the problem of identifying shopping trends, the following data-driven solution is proposed. This solution will help businesses stay competitive by identifying and responding to shopping trends in a timely, efficient, and data-driven manner.

# Actionable Recommendations Software Requirements
**Python 3.x**: The programming language used for data analysis. 
**NumPy**: For numerical data operations and array manipulation. 
**Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis Seaborn: For statistical data visualization. 
**jupyter Notebook**: Python IDE Matplotlib: For additional plotting capabilities.

# Identifying Shopping Trends using Data Analysis
This project analyzes shopping trends data to uncover valuable insights about customer behavior, preferences, and purchasing patterns. Through comprehensive data analysis, we explore various aspects of shopping trends to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to gain insights from customer shopping data, such as trends in customer age, gender, payment methods, and preferred product categories. The project includes the analysis of different customer attributes and their spending behavior. It uses libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for data analysis and visualization.

# Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks for documentation

# Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing information about 3900 customers' shopping behaviors, including:

- Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer
- Age: Age of the customer
- Gender: Gender of the customer
- Item Purchased: Name of the item purchased
- Category: Category of the item purchased (e.g., Clothing, Footwear, etc.)
- Purchase Amount (USD): The amount spent in USD
- Location: The customer's location
- Size: The size of the purchased item
- Color: The color of the purchased item
- Season: The season during which the purchase was made (e.g., Winter, Summer)
- Review Rating: The rating given by the customer for the purchased item
- Subscription Status: Whether the customer has a subscription (Yes/No)
- Payment Method: The method used for payment (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal)
- Shipping Type: Type of shipping used (e.g., Express, Free Shipping)
- Discount Applied: Whether a discount was applied to the purchase
- Promo Code Used: Whether a promo code was used during the purchase
- Previous Purchases: Number of previous purchases made by the customer
- Preferred Payment Method: The preferred payment method of the customer
- Frequency of Purchases: Frequency of purchases made by the customer

# Analysis and Visualizations
This project includes various types of visualizations:

- Customer Spending Analysis
- Relationship Between Location and Items Purchased
- What is the overall distribution of customer ages in the dataset
- Distribution of Payment Methods
